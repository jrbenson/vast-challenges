        Patterns of Life considers the patterns of daily life throughout the
        city. You will describe the daily routines for some representative
        people, characterize the travel patterns to identify potential
        bottlenecks or hazards, and examine how these patterns change over time
        and seasons.

        Using the transactional data of the participant's daily routines we
        identified various distinct areas in the city. Particularly, the city
        can be divided into areas with residential and business use.

        Most of the residential buildings (shown as yellow in the figure below)
        are in the outer areas of the city which means long commutes to business
        locations (shown as red). Combining the business district heat map and
        residential information reveals a potential source of bottlenecks during
        peak hours as employees travel from the outer city areas into each of
        the business districts.

        Comparing residential rental costs for different areas of the city
        reveals that many high-cost apartments are close to the city center and
        in close proximity to business locations.

        Looking into the happiness score for participants shows that the
        majority of people are happier if they live close to the center of the
        city. Likely shorter commutes, better access to facilities, and
        employment options contribute.

        Because some buildings contain both businesses and apartments we need to
        further in on specific business locations using the employer data. Using
        a heat map visualization of employer locations we discovered three
        business hubs within the city.

        Dividing homes by age group shows that younger generations are drawn
        towards the city center. Older people tend to live further out with
        especially high concentration in the north-west part of the city.

        Participants with more than one job typically live closer to the city

      <p>
        The traffic patterns of the city depend very much upon the time of the
        day. Many people are commuting to work and increased traffic is
        measurable during 8-9AM and 4-5PM each day. Animating traffic changes at
        each hour reveals the shift in these patterns.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <figcaption>???</figcaption>
        <sas-report-page

        ><img src="img/fig-c2-q2-1.png" class="static" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        There are several potential areas of concern. In particular the two
        connecting gateways in the north and south east show consistent traffic
        bottlenecks at the peak hour (4-5PM).
      </p>

      <p>
        Breaking down the traffic patterns based on the business district they
        are traveling to reveal more nuanced patterns? For example, almost 50%
        of all employees traveling to the Eastern Business District do so from
        the western parts of the city, which can take over an hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comparing travel during weekdays and weekends reveals very different
        patterns. For instance, the average mid-day traffic (11AM-3PM) on
        weekends is twice as high as on business days. In contrast, evening
        traffic is always higher on weekdays.

      <h4>Participant 40</h4>

      <p>
        We have selected participant <strong>40</strong> as our first case
        study. This 55-year old lives in a household of three with children and
        works for two employers during the year. Initially working at
        <em>jobId 228</em> they tried three other jobs for a few days until
        <em>jobId 534</em> was accepted in April 2022. The change in employment
        is also reflected in the change of daily travel pattern. The days spent
        working were different (<em>jobId 228</em> was from Monday through
        Friday and <em>jobId 534</em> was from Friday through Wednesday. They
        also received a pay increase ($2) for <em>jobId 534</em>.
      </p>

        Participant <strong>40</strong>'s activity dashboard reveals their daily
        life. The participant was typically at home between 1-7pm or engaged in
        recreational activities between 6-23pm. Lunches were usually eaten at a
        restaurant at 2pm.
      </p>

      <p>
        After April the change in employment changed their routine
        significantly. Thursday's schedule in particular is different since they
        no longer worked that day. The following figure shows a transition from
        a typical workday route (Home > Work > Restaurant (Lunch) > Work) in
        March to a more weekend style routine (Home > Restaurant > Home) in May.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not surprisingly participant <strong>40</strong> spends most of their
        time during the year at home (<em>apartmentId 977</em>) and working for
        <em>jobId 534</em> (<em>employerId 862</em>). They also visited various
        pubs and restaurants during that time, with <em>pubId 443</em> being the
        favorite lunch location.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participant travels mostly at 8am and 2pm to commute to work and
        nearly as frequently at 5pm to restaurants and pubs. On average the
        participants spends a bit more than 30min commuting to and from work and
        only 12 minutes traveling to eat.

        More detailed examination of travel routes shows the change in
        workplace. Participant <strong>40</strong> changed to
        <em>jobId 534</em> in April after working for one month (34 days) at
        <em>jobId 228</em>. They stayed at <em>job 534</em>
        for the reminder of the year. Comparing daily routines between March and
        April reflects the new home to work commute.

      <h4>Participant 50</h4>

      <p>
        The second participant example is participant <strong>50</strong>. This
        45 year old, educated person lives in a three person household. They had
        a single job during the entire study, working from Sunday to Thursday
        each day. This participant earns more than twice as much ($29) as
        participant 40.

        The activity dashboard in the following figure reveals a similar daily
        pattern as the previous participant. However, they don't eat at a
        restaurant for lunch, instead eat at restaurants for breakfast (8-10am)
        and dinner (7-22pm). This participants also more frequently travels to
        recreational activities after work between 6-22pm.

        Most of their time is spent at home, followed by their place of work
        (<em>employerId 400</em>). 8am and 5pm are the busiest times of the day
        for this participant when they are commuting to and from work. They have
        significantly longer commutes, on average 1 hour, which are twice as
        long as participant 40's commutes.

        With only one job during the entire year the travel pattern for
        participant <strong>50</strong> does not change much. They are primarily
        active in the north eastern part of the city with daily commute to work
        in the the southern part of the city.

        Overall activity levels for participants remain at similar levels during
        the entire study. However there are changes in activity across
        individual months. The following figure shows the percentage change
        grouped by activity mode, showing for example that recreational
        activities dropped by 12% in the month of November.

      <p>
        There are moderate declines in commute activity at various times of the
        day. In particular the weekend travel patterns show a slight decrease in
        average traffic counts towards the end of the study.

        During weekdays the morning and evening traffic increases in August but
        decreases in February. Traffic levels for the remainder of the study
        period remain largely the same.

        Participants without children spend more time (averaging about 4
        minutes) at recreational or social activities on Tuesday, Wednesday and
        Thursday. The total number of activities on those days doesn't change
        significantly, just the duration. Recreational activities are three
        times as common on weekends as they are on weekdays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Total weekend traffic is highest in July, October, and April of 2023.
        However, weekday traffic is highest in August and March of 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traffic patterns don't show significant geographical changes during the
        study period. However, one can observe a slight change in traffic
        concentration in November and December. A hotspot for traffic congestion
        moves from one area to another (from the blue marker to the green in the
        following figure) indicating that some event may have been responsible
        for this temporary shift.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants with more than one job experience more variance in where
        they create high traffic areas due to the changing of jobs. November
        seems to be the peak travel activity for this group of participants but
        December is the lowest. These participants also typically only travel
        short distances, due to living closer to work locations.
