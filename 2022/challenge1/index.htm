        demographics. Given social networks and other information about the
        city, you will analyze the available data to prepare a one-page fact
        sheet about the city's demographics, its neighborhoods, and its business
        base.

        There are several anomalies in the first few days of the study, such as
        people having multiple jobs with some lasting only 5 minutes. The study
        started with 1,011 participants with 32 dropping out after 4 days and
        another 99 dropping out after 5 days. None of the participants who
        dropped out of the study lived in an apartment and they all traveled to
        School. Our conclusion is these participants stayed in the dorms at
        college/university and traveled home at the end of the school year. The
        remaining 880 participants completed the study, which ran 450 days.

        Apartments and Employers. Participants also had a longer average time

        Using SAS Viya's network analytics procedure, we searched for various
        travel patterns to better understand the daily social activities of the
        participants. When analyzing patterns, we took into account the travel
        end location, purpose and check-in time. Using pattern match algorithm,
        we are able to determine the frequency of given patterns in the data.
        The following patterns have been identified:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>checkInDays</dt>
        <dd>Number of unique days with at least one logged activity</dd>

        <dt>goingToEatAtWork</dt>
        <dd>
          The participant goes to work, eats in the middle of work, then goes
          home.
        </dd>
        <dt>twoJobs</dt>
        <dd>
          The participant goes to work at one job then goes to work at a
          different job.
        </dd>
        <dt>twoShifts</dt>
        <dd>
          The participant goes to work at one job, goes home, then goes to work
          at the same job.
        </dd>
        <dt>goingToPubAtWork</dt>
        <dd>
          The participant goes to work, goes to a pub in the middle of work,
          then goes home.
        </dd>
        <dt>goingToPubAfterWork</dt>
        <dd>The participant goes to work, comes home, then goes to a pub.</dd>
        <dt>goingToEatAfterWork</dt>
        <dd>
          The participant goes to work, comes home, then goes to a restaurant.
        </dd>
        <dt>multiplePubsOneDay</dt>
        <dd>The participant goes out to at least two pubs.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        These patterns can be grouped into
        <em>Working</em>, <em>Pub</em>, and <em>Restaurant</em> visits to better
        describe their daily social activities.

        Eating out is a common activity after work and in general. The median
        participant ate out 469 times in total and ate out 130 times after a
        work day (40% of the work days).

        Visiting pubs were a common activity even though 13 participants
        refrained from going to pubs altogether. Thankfully no participant went
        to a pub during a work shift. However going to pubs after work and on
        non-work days was common, often multiple times in one day. The median
        participant went to a pub 364 times in total, 71 times after work (22%
        of the work days), and had 100 days that contained multiple pub trips.

        The citizens in the study primarily went to two locations during their
        free time: pubs and restaurants. Pubs were the dominant place to engage
        in social gatherings. There are five primary locations of pubs and
        restaurants:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Central</li>
        <li>North Central</li>
        <li>Northwest</li>
        <li>East</li>
        <li>South</li>
      </ul>

        Throughout the study, two pubs dominated all sales in the central part
        of town: 1342 and 1344. These two pubs made up over 20% of all sales
        alone. Additionally when performing a network analysis of the travel
        network involving business pubs 1342 and 1344 had nearly twice the
        centrality score of any other business, implying that they are a common
        gathering location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly 78% of all pub and restaurant sales occurred between the
        Northwest, Southwest Central, and Central parts of town.

        Restaurants had the lowest number of sales within the study. Sales
        tended to be distributed throughout the city relatively evenly, but the
        central part of the city had the lowest number of sales. The best
        performing restaurant, 1801, is located in the northwest part of the
        city. The poorest performing restaurant, 1349, is located in the central
        part of the city.

        Throughout the course of the study, Restaurants and Pubs were shown to
        have very different behavior in terms of the times that participants
        spent money. Regardless of the location of the pub, participants tended
        to spend the most money on weekends between 9AM and 12:00AM, and
        weekdays from 5PM to 12:00AM. Pubs tended to have fewer sales on
        weekdays between 6AM and 4PM.

        Restaurants told another story. Restaurants, however, generate most of
        their revenue between 7AM and 8AM on weekends and 11AM and 3PM on
        weekdays.

        Sales for pubs across all regions exhibit identical seasonality, with
        the most sales occurring on Saturday and the least sales occurring on
        Wednesdays. There is no growth in spending for either restaurants or
        pubs based on these participants' habits. Sales declined between March
        and May before stabilizing to an overall average of approximately
        $469,000/month.

      <p>
        Restaurants, however, tell a different story. Seasonality is rarely
        exhibited within the identified districts, but individual restaurants
        often exhibit their own seasonality. When grouped together in districts,
        restaurants tend to have erratic seasonality. This is due to each
        individual restaurant's patterns not matching up with other restaurants.
        For example, Restaurant 1804 has very clear seasonality that peaks on
        Sundays, but this seasonality is not identical to other restaurants in
        the Southern district.

        We discovered 6 clusters of weekly sale patterns by restaurants and
        pubs. There is no clear relationship between weekly sales patterns and
        location within the city. The y axis represents normalized total sales.
        The higher the value, the greater the sales at that time. The clusters
        below are zoomed in to a representative date range and is designed to
        show the general shape of sales patterns over time.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Cluster 1</dt>
        <dd>
          Consists almost entirely of pubs with the exception of a single
          restaurant (895) that has similar demand patterns to pubs. Saturday
          and Sunday both have sharp increases in sales. Weekdays tend to have
          much fewer sales.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cluster 2</dt>
        <dd>
          Restaurants whose sales tend to be greatest during weekdays. Weekends
          have fewer sales.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cluster 3</dt>
        <dd>
          Restaurants whose sales tend to be greatest on Saturday followed by
          Sunday. Weekdays have fewer sales.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cluster 4</dt>
        <dd>
          Two restaurants whose sales are relatively evenly distributed across
          weekdays with few peaks in-between.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cluster 5</dt>
        <dd>
          Four restaurants whose sales are generally higher on weekdays but tend
          to have slightly higher sales on weekends compared to clusters 2, 3,
          and 4. Sales tend to be more erratic throughout the week compared to
          other clusters.
        </dd>

        <dt>Cluster 6</dt>
        <dd>
          Four restaurants whose sales tend to peak on Sundays, with Saturday
          close behind.
